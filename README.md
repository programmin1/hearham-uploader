# hearham-uploader
Hearham uploader software

# Requirements

2GB free disk space
Any recent Ubuntu/debian should work.
SDR device for input is recommended.

# Setup
Run "./setup.sh" once to download and compile all necessary files. May take 10min or so.

Run ./HearHamUploader.py to start the recognizer.

hear.config has some options you may want to try, there are many options in the referenced .jconf files too.

# Running

With a radio next to the mic (or better yet, SDR software and the audio loopback described here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSeINGM68A8)
you should see text roughly equivalent to what is spoken. When it's set up, enter your secret upload key that you got when setting up a channel on hearham.com.
